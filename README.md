Deep reinforcement learning program to generate arbitary quantum states. It is able to learn a two-dimensional set of superposition states, the learning is performed on all target states at the same time. Based on spinning Up AI.


Prerequisites:
- OpenAi spinningup https://spinningup.openai.com/ (follow instructions there to install)
- matplotlib for plotting
- Qutip (http://qutip.org/) to run the quantum simulation part
- scipy
